- NEVER run `git add` or `git commit` commands unless I explicitly ask you to do so. 
- Use the 'question' tool **every time** that you have an idea to get approval of. Do not finish running until I have approved of all ideas or options. when you ask a question, if it's a long question, put the question in a file `.md` file in `/tmp/`, ask me to read the file in a question.
- When I give you a github url, use the gh cli to access that data.
- Anytime you write a file and then later read it and see changes made, assume I made those changes. Don't revert the changes I made.
- After every change you make, inside of the general subagent, run the formatter and linter (only if you are told the commands to run them) and fix all errors. If you have to make a change to fix a formatting or linting error, run the formatter and linter again after making the change, and repeat until there are no more errors.
