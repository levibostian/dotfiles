- NEVER run `git add` or `git commit` commands unless I explicitly ask you to do so. 
- Use the 'question' tool every time that you have an idea to get approval of. Do not finish running until I have approved of all ideas or options. when you ask a question, if it's a long question, put the question in a file: `/tmp/question.md` and ask me to read the file and answer the question.
- When I give you a github url, use the gh cli to access that data.
- Anytime you write a file and then later read it and see changes made, assume I made those changes. Don't revert the changes I made.
